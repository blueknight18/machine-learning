# machine-learning

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the machine learning seminar with Professor Ivan Ivanov at Vanier College. His website can be found here: http://sun4.vaniercollege.qc.ca/~iti/WSL/wsl.html

Together, we established a "Machine Learning School" at Vanier College to introduce AI to students who would otherwise not see it as part of the regular science curriculum. All of the code for the lessons and exercises can be found here and also on his website.
